# CI/CD Demonstration Application

This repository contains a simple application designed to demonstrate the functionality of **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) pipelines using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 📋 Features

- Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- Automated testing, lint and build on every _pull request_.
- Automated preview deployment to every branch push except main branch with vercel.
- Automated production deployment to every main branch push with vercel.

---

## 🚀 Primary technologies used

- **Node.js**: Primary language for the application.
- **Typescript**: Adds additional syntax to JavaScript.
- **ExpressJs**: API Restful framework.
- **Jest**: Testing framework (for code validation).
- **GitHub Actions**: Tool for managing the CI/CD pipeline.

## 🤖 CI/CD Setup with GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline is configured in the `.github/workflows/` directory and consists of three main workflows:

1. **Lint, Tests, and Build**:
   - **Workflow file**: `lint-tests-build.yml`
   - This workflow handles code quality checks (linting), runs unit tests to ensure the application functions as expected, and builds the application for deployment.

2. **Preview Deployment**:
   - **Workflow file**: `preview.yml`
   - Deploys the application to a preview environment (e.g., Vercel) to validate changes before pushing them to production.

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - **Workflow file**: `deploy.yml`
   - Deploys the application to the production environment (e.g., Vercel) after successful testing and preview validation. 

Each workflow is designed to run specific steps independently, ensuring a streamlined and modular CI/CD process.
